# COSC314_Project_1
I really don't know my way around github and I'm sure that the formatting of this repository looks really disorganized, so sorry about that.
Anyways, here's the output for the code in the main.java file:

True
False
False
False

True
True
True
False

False
True
True
False

True
False
True
True

True
False
False
True

Imagine that the True's and False's are vertical because that's how it's outputted in the console and I don't know how to fix that here.
Also, I uploaded both the two java files as well as the zipped project1 file because I don't know if the files themselves can work without the other files in project1.
